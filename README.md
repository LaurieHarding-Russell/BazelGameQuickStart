## Quick start
Run `./bazelQuickStart.sh`

## Why?
Are you too lazy to write all the boilerplate, but too stuborn to use a framework like unity? Then this is the middle ground. Generate the boilerplate. Then change what you need to later.

## Contribute?
Sure why not. Make a PR and maybe I'll merge it in.


## Design Decisions
### Why Bazel?
- Multiple language support
- Its fast
- Its extendable
